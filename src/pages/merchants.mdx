# Merchants

This page highlights key considerations for merchants who accept cashu in exchange for goods and services.

There are two recommended setups for accepting ecash as payment.

## Accept ecash from trusted mints, then melt occasionally

_You accept cashu as payment if the token is valid. You do not melt (convert it to LN sats) right away._

Keep in mind:
- Before accepting a cashu token as payment, validate it by ensuring that
  - it has the correct amount
  - it has the correct unit
  - it is from one of your trusted mints
- If the received cashu token is valid, always swap it before treating the transaction as complete.
- If you use NUT-18 Payment Requests, always specify the trusted mints in the `m` field of the request.
- Remember to regularly melt your cashu tokens to LN sats, for example when a certain balance is reached or at a set interval.
- Remember to account for swap and melt fees.

## Accept cashu from any mint and immediately melt

_You accept cashu from any mint, if the token is valid and you successfully melt it to LN right away._

Keep in mind:
- Before accepting a cashu token as payment, validate it by ensuring that
  - it has the correct amount (expected LN amount + `fee_reserve`)
  - it has the correct unit
  - the token was successfully melted
- Remember to account for `fee_reserve` when showing the "pay with ecash" price in the UI (price when paying with cashu = price when paying with LN + `fee_reserve`).
- Consider that `fee_reserve` may underestimate the LN fees, which can cause the melt to fail. In this case, consider increasing the `fee_reserve`.
- To reduce or eliminate LN fees, open LN channels with your trusted mints.
